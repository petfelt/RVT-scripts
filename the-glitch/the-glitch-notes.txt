The Glitch Notes
 - Might need to make it host-only, using client detection technique.
 - won't work on CGB. Rip.

Other gamemode notes:

Depth Chargers:
 - Check player's team more often to make sure local code FX are only for humans. (Who knows...)
 - Increase damage of grenade turrets?

Whack-a-Mole:
 - Make sure players have a score counter above them

Bomber Zombies:
 - Increase normal player speed by 10% (DONE)
 - Lower last man speed by 10% (DONE)
 - Investigate scoring not working for zombies (maybe fixed?)
