Label fast artillery vs. bounce-shot & handheld region. (Not necessarily necessary - double check)
 - Add lines to show where to shoot angled line, based on range. (Might not need - check)

Place appropriate number of turrets. (DONE)

Place checkpoints for humans. (DONE)
 - Checkpoints could go in random order, or in order? See if we can get a user setting here. (DONE)


Apply player trait to do more dmg when holding grenade launcher? (FIXED - Now dmg change only applied when in vehicles in zone.)


Add zones for different amounts of damage as zombie. (DONE)
 - See why upper zombie zone is not telling player about damage amount. (DONE)

Possibly track projectiles shot, keep counter of how many enter box successfully?
(Might be expensive...worth it or not?)
 - Add a waypoint to each projectile (DONE)
 - Can then keep count if projectile enters a zone.



RACE NOTES: (DONE)
 - Only just started with code
 - calculate distance
    VARIABLE REPLACEMENTS:
 - global_object[1]: global_object[3]
 - current_object.number[0]: same
 - current_player.number[0]: current_player.number[4]
 - global.number[2]: global.number[10]

 - on 7 of 12 "race_flag" in file
	- Need a global.number[2] replacement.
