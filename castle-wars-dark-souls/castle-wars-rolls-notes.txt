Gamemode done. Now uses crouch functionality.

OLD INFO:
Grenade ability script variables:
global.number[5]
global.number[6]
global.object[2]
global.object[3] - only if we want to throw something different
global.object[4] - player.biped
global.player[2] - player
player.number[2] - set to 1, so player can change abilities.

Player swap abilities variables:
global.object[4] - current_player.get_armor_ability()
player.number[3] - used for number of iFrames in evade


CHANGE FROM GRENADES TO CROUCH!!

TO ADD:

 - Make two new script options do things.
   - turn off unlimited sprint
   - determine number of frames to be invincible for
 - Tell player when they are invincible. (Maybe number of iframes told on HUD?)



POSSIBLY:

 - Make new mode where you t-bag to change abilities, use all abilities?

Abilities:

 - Active Camo
 - Armor Lock
 - Sprint
 - Evade
 - Drop Shield
 - Jetpack
 - Hologram
